"Task Manager CLI
A simple command-line interface (CLI) application in Python to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. 
This tool allows you to add new tasks with descriptions, list all your tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks you no longer need. 
Tasks are saved persistently in a local file so that your data is preserved between sessions."
